# Lab 7 #
For Lab 7, I am learning how to use ThingSpeak and Google Sheets. The first step was to sign up for ThingSpeak but fortunately, I already have an account, so I just had to log in. Next, I needed to create new channel cpu_loop with field1 cpu_pc and field2 mem_avail_mb:

After I saved the channel, I navigated to channel and copied the Write API key.
When it was time to start sudo installing packages, I created a virtual environment as seen below:
