# Lab 10 #
### For Lab 10, I learned about Blockchain ###
### I started with the commands on hash_value.py and received the following (Note: I use command python not python3): ###
```

"""
https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED
If PYTHONHASHSEED is not set or set to random, a random value is used to to seed the hashes of str and bytes objects.
If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization.
Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash values.
The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0 will disable hash randomization.

https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/hash
hash(object) returns the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers.
They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup.
Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0.
For objects with custom __hash__() methods, note that hash() truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine.
"""

# hash for integer unchanged
print('The hash for 1 is:', hash(1))

# hash for decimal
print('The hash for 1.0 is:',hash(1.0))
print('The hash for 3.14 is:',hash(3.14))

# hash for string
print('The hash for Python is:', hash('Python'))

# hash for a tuple of vowels
vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
print('The hash for a tuple of vowels is:', hash(vowels))

### Next, I execute the following code in python within my terminal as follows: ###
```

```
 ### I then build the tiniest blockchain in less than 50 lines of Python by Gerald Nash: ###
